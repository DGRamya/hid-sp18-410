\section{Edge Computing}

Edge computing is a method of optimising cloud computing systems by 
performing data processing at the edge of the network, near the source of 
the data. This reduces the communications bandwidth needed between sensors 
and the central data centre by performing analytics and knowledge generation 
at or near the source of the data. This approach requires leveraging resources 
that may not be continuously connected to a network such as laptops, 
smartphones, tablets and sensors.Edge computing covers a wide range of 
technologies including wireless sensor networks, mobile data acquisition, 
mobile signature analysis, cooperative distributed peer-to-peer ad hoc 
networking and processing also classifiable as local cloud/fog computing 
and grid/mesh computing, dew computing, mobile edge computing,cloudlet, 
distributed data storage and retrieval, autonomic self-healing networks, 
remote cloud services \cite{edge}
