\section{Amazon Redshift}

Amazon Redshift is a fast, fully managed data warehouse that makes it simple 
and cost-effective to analyze all your data using standard SQL and your 
existing Business Intelligence (BI) tools. It allows you to run complex 
analytic queries against petabytes of structured data, using sophisticated 
query optimization, columnar storage on high-performance local disks, and 
massively parallel query execution \cite{Amazon Redshift}

Amazon Redshift is an Internet hosting service and data warehouse product 
announced in November 2012 which forms part of the larger cloud-computing 
platform Amazon Web Services. It is built on top of technology from the 
massive parallel processing (MPP) data-warehouse company ParAccel 
(later acquired by Actian),to handle large scale data sets and database 
migrations.Redshift differs from Amazon's other hosted database offering, 
Amazon RDS, in its ability to handle analytics workloads on big data data sets 
stored by a column-oriented DBMS principle \cite{AmazonWiki}
