\section{ELK Stack}

"ELK" is the acronym for three open source projects: Elasticsearch, Logstash, 
and Kibana. Elasticsearch is a search and analytics engine. Logstash is a 
serverâ€‘side data processing pipeline that ingests data from multiple sources 
simultaneously, transforms it, and then sends it to a "stash" like 
Elasticsearch. Kibana lets users visualize data with charts and graphs in 
Elasticsearch \cite{ELKBlog}. Elasticsearch is one of most scalable indexing 
solutions upto date that can take any data pushed by the Logstash which 
usually pushes the logs real time to the pipeline and Kibana is a GUI that 
provides a good platform to visualize and report out data if required by the 
business.
