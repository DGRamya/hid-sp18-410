\section{Cloudlet}


A cloudlet is a mobility-enhanced small-scale cloud datacenter that is located 
at the edge of the Internet. The main purpose of the cloudlet is supporting 
resource-intensive and interactive mobile applications by providing powerful 
computing resources to mobile devices with lower latency. It is a new 
architectural element that extends todayâ€™s cloud computing infrastructure. 
It represents the middle tier of a 3-tier hierarchy: mobile device - cloudlet 
- cloud. A cloudlet can be viewed as a data center in a box whose goal is to 
bring the cloud closer. The cloudlet term was first coined by M. Satyanarayanan 
and a prototype implementation is developed by Carnegie Mellon University as a 
research project.The concept of cloudlet is also known as follow me cloud,and 
mobile micro-cloud \cite{wikiCloudlet}
